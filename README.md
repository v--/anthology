# Notebook

[![CI](https://github.com/v--/notebook/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/v--/notebook/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)

This is an ever-expanding document containing some of the mathematics notes and proofs that I write while studying. Having all these notes in one place is quite helpful for later reference.

If you happen to find any mistakes or room for improvements, feel free to create an issue or a pull request.

The corresponding PDF, kept up-to-date using GitHub Actions, can be found [here](https://ivasilev.net/files/Notebook.pdf).
