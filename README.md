# Anthology

[![CI](https://github.com/v--/anthology/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/v--/anthology/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild)

This is an ever-expanding document containing some of the mathematics notes and proofs that I write while studying. Having all these notes in one place is quite helpful for later reference.

The corresponding PDF, kept up-to-date using GitHub Actions, can be found [here](https://ivasilev.net/files/Anthology.pdf).
