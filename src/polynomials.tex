\subsection{Polynomials}\label{subsec:polynomials}

\begin{remark}\label{remark:polynomial_commutative_ring}
  In this subsection, \( R \) will refer to a nontrivial commutative unital ring\Tinyref{def:semiring/commutative_unital_ring}.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}\label{def:polynomial}\cite[149]{Knapp2016BAlg}
  A \Def{polynomial} \( p \) over \( R \) is a sequence of members of \( R \) called \Def{coefficients},
  \begin{equation*}
    p \coloneqq ( a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots ) \subseteq R,
  \end{equation*}
  such that only finitely many coefficients are nonzero.

  \begin{defenum}
    \DItem{def:polynomial/zero_polynomial} An exception to most rules is the \Def{zero polynomial}, all of whose coefficients are zeroes.

    \DItem{def:polynomial/leading_coefficient} The last nonzero coefficient of a nonzero polynomial is called the \Def{leading coefficient} and is denoted by \( \LC(p) \).

    \DItem{def:polynomial/degree} The zero-based index of the leading coefficient is called the \Def{degree} of the polynomial as is denoted by \( \deg(p) \). That is, if only \( a_0 \) is nonzero, then \( \deg(p) = a_0 \). The degree of the zero polynomial is left undefined.

    \DItem{def:polynomial/expression} It is conventional to write a polynomial of degree \( k \) as the expression\Tinyref{def:language}
    \begin{equation*}
      p(X) \coloneqq a_k X^k + a_{k-1} X^{k-1} + \ldots + a_2 X^2 + a_1 X + a_0 = \sum_{i=0}^k a_k X^k
    \end{equation*}
    and the zero polynomial as
    \begin{equation*}
      p(X) \coloneqq 0.
    \end{equation*}

    We use capital letters to highlight that this is not a function - see \Tinyref{def:polynomial_function}.

    \DItem{def:polynomial/degree_names} Polynomials of degree \( k \) with special names include
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \Def{constant} for the zero polynomial or if \( n = 0 \).
      \item \Def{linear} if \( n = 1 \).
      \item \Def{quadratic} if \( n = 2 \).
      \item \Def{cubic} if \( n = 3 \).
      \item \Def{quartic} if \( n = 4 \).
      \item \Def{quintic} if \( n = 5 \).
    \end{itemize}
  \end{defenum}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:algebra_of_polynomials}
  Denote by \( R[X] \) the set of polynomials over \( R \). Note that it is bijective with \( c_{00} \) and we can inherit pointwise addition and scalar multiplication from there. That is,

  \begin{defenum}
    \DItem{def:algebra_of_polynomials/addition} We define \Def{polynomial addition} point as
    \begin{align*}
      &+: R[X] \times R[X] \to R[X] \\
      &(a_0, a_1, \ldots) + (b_0, b_1, \ldots) \coloneqq (a_0 + b_0, b_0 + b_1, \ldots)
    \end{align*}

    \DItem{def:algebra_of_polynomials/scalar_multiplication} We define \Def{scalar multiplication} as
    \begin{align*}
      &\cdot: R[X] \times R[X] \to R[X] \\
      &t \cdot (a_0, a_1, \ldots) \coloneqq (t a_0, t b_1, \ldots)
    \end{align*}

    \DItem{def:algebra_of_polynomials/matrix_multiplication} In order to make \( R[X] \) into an algebra\Tinyref{def:algebra_over_ring}, we define \Def{polynomial multiplication} \( \odot: R[X] \times R[X] \to R[X] \) as follows: if \( (a_0, a_1, \ldots) \) and \( (b_0, b_1, \ldots) \) are polynomials, their product is defined to be the polynomial with coefficients
    \begin{equation}
      c_l \coloneqq \sum_{i+j=l} a_i b_j, l = 0, 1, \ldots.
    \end{equation}

    Polynomial multiplication is bilinear, associative and commutative.
  \end{defenum}

  We usually refer to \( R[X] \) as the \Def{polynomial ring}. We will implicitly use the canonical embedding \( \iota: R \to R[X] \), which sends an element \( r \) of \( R \) into the constant polynomial \( p(X) \coloneqq r \).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:polynomial_ring_universal_property}\cite[150]{Knapp2016BAlg}
  For any nontrivial commutative unital ring \( T \), any unital ring homomorphism \( \varphi: R \to T \) and any \( t \in T \), there exists a unique homomorphism \( \Phi_t: R[X] \to T \) such that \( \iota(1) = t \) and the following diagram commutes:

  \begin{AlignedEquation}\label{thm:polynomial_ring_universal_property/diagram}
    \begin{mplibcode}
      beginfig(1);
        input metapost/graphs;

        v1 := thelabel("$R$", origin);
        v2 := thelabel("$R[X]$", (2, 0) scaled u);
        v3 := thelabel("$T$", (1, -1) scaled u);

        a1 := straight_arc(v1, v2);
        a2 := straight_arc(v1, v3);

        d1 := straight_arc(v2, v3);

        draw_vertices(v);
        draw_arcs(a);
        drawarrow d1 dotted;

        label.top("$\iota$", straight_arc_midpoint of a1);
        label.llft("$\varphi$", straight_arc_midpoint of a2);
        label.lrt("$\Phi_t$", straight_arc_midpoint of d1);
      endfig;
    \end{mplibcode}
  \end{AlignedEquation}

  We will call the map \( \Phi_t \) a \Def{substitution homomorphism}. If \( T = R \), we simply call \( \Phi_r \) it an \Def{evaluation} at \( r \in R \).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  We will first prove uniqueness. Let \( \Phi: R[X] \to T \) and \( \Psi: R[X] \to T \) are two such homomorphisms and take their difference \( \Theta \coloneqq \Phi - \Psi \).

  Then for \( r \in R \) we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \Theta(\iota(r)) = \Psi(\iota(r)) - \Psi(\iota(r)) = \varphi(r) - \varphi(r) = 0.
  \end{equation*}

  Now since for any polynomial we have \( p = \iota(1) p \) and since \( \Theta \) is a homomorphism of rings, we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \Theta(p) = \Theta(\iota(1) p) = 0 \Theta(p) = 0.
  \end{equation*}

  Thus \( \Theta = 0 \) and \( \Phi = \Psi \).

  Now we will show existence. Take a polynomial
  \begin{equation*}
    p = (a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n, 0, 0, \ldots).
  \end{equation*}

  Define
  \begin{equation*}
    \Phi(p) \coloneqq \sum_{i=1}^n \phi(a_0) t^i.
  \end{equation*}

  By additivity, \( \Phi: R[X] \to T \) is obviously a homomorphism and \( \Phi((0, 1, 0, \ldots)) = t \). Therefore we have proven existence.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:polynomial_function}
  Let \( \Cat{Set}(R, R) \) be the unital ring of all functions\Tinyref{thm:functions_over_ring_form_algebra} from \( R \) to itself. Define the unital ring homomorphism
  \begin{align*}
    &\Phi: R[X] \to \Cat{Set}(R, R) \\
    &\Phi((a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n, 0, 0, \ldots)) \coloneqq \left( x \to \sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^n \right),
  \end{align*}
  which constructs a \Def{polynomial function} from a polynomial. This map is not injective in general and multiple polynomials may be equivalent as functions\Tinyref{def:function}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label{remark:polynomial_vs_polynomial_function}
  Since we mostly care about polynomials over \( \R \) and \( \Co \), \cref{thm:polynomial_monomorphism_into_polynomial_functions} allows us to identify polynomial functions with their sequences of coefficients.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}\label{def:multivariate_polynomial}
  We define the \Def{multivariate polynomial ring} in \( k \) indeterminates as the \enquote{iterated} single-variable polynomial ring
  \begin{equation*}
    R[X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k] \coloneqq R[X_1][X_2] \cdots [X_k].
  \end{equation*}

  Each polynomial \( p(X_1, \ldots, X_k) \) is an \( k \)-dimensional array\Tinyref{def:array} over \( R \). If there are only two variables, multivariate polynomials are matrices
  \begin{equation*}
    p(X_1, X_2) \coloneqq \begin{pmatrix}
      a_{0,0} & a_{0,1} & \cdots \\
      a_{1,0} & a_{1,1} & \cdots \\
      \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots \\
    \end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation*}
  with only finitely many nonzero elements.

  A \Def{monomial} is a polynomial with only one nonzero element. The monomial
  \begin{equation*}
    p(X_1, X_2) \coloneqq \begin{pmatrix}
      0       & 0       & 0       & \cdots \\
      0       & 0       & 0       & \cdots \\
      0       & r       & 0       & \cdots \\
      0       & 0       & 0       & \cdots \\
      \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots \\
    \end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation*}
  can also be written symbolically as \( p(X_1, X_2) = r X_1^2 X_2 \), with the power for each variable corresponding to the zero-based index of the element along the corresponding axis.

  The sum of the indices over all axes is called the \Def{degree} of this monomial. The above monomial has degree \( 3 = 2 + 1 \). We leave the degree for the zero monomial undefined.

  Every polynomial can be regarded as the sum of finitely many monomials by taking each element of the array and putting it in its own monomial array.

  The \Def{degree} \( \deg p \) of a multivariate polynomial \( p \) is defined as the maximal degree among all of its nonzero monomials. If all monomials are zero, the degree is left undefined.

  If all nonzero monomials have the same degree, the polynomial is said to be \Def{homogeneous}. A homogeneous multivariate polynomial of degree \( 1 \) is called \Def{linear}.
\end{definition}
