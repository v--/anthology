\subsection{Asplund spaces}\label{subsec:asplund_spaces}

\begin{definition}\label{def:asplund_space}
  The Banach space \( X \) is called an Asplund (resp. weak Asplund) space if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

  \begin{DefEnum}
    \ILabel{def:asplund_space/differentiable_on_dense_subset}\MarginCite[thm. 2.14]{Phelps1993}Every continuous convex function on a convex open subset \( D \) of \( X \) is Frechet (resp. Gateaux) differentiable at a dense \( G_\delta \) subset of \( D \).

    \ILabel{def:asplund_space/radon_nikodym}\MarginCite[def. 5.2]{Phelps1993}The dual space \( X^* \) has the Radon-Nikodym property.

    \medskip

    \ILabel{def:asplund_space/exposed_points}\MarginCite[thm. 5.12]{Phelps1993}Every nonempty weak* compact convex subset of \( X^* \) is the weak* closed convex hull of its weak* strongly exposed points.
  \end{DefEnum}
\end{definition}
