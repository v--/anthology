Let $X$ be a Hausdorff topological vector space\Tinyref{def:topological_vector_space}, let $D \subseteq X$ be an open set and $f: D \to \Real$ be any function.

\begin{definition}\label{def:subdifferentials}
  We fix a point $x \in D$. We define different types of \uline{subgradients} and \uline{subdifferentials}. Subgradients are linear functionals $x^* \in X^*$ that approximate $f$ at the point $x$ in a certain way, and a subdifferential is the set of all subgradients of a given type.

  \begin{defenum}
    \item\label{def:subdifferentials/convex}\cite[59]{Clarke2013} We say that $x^* \in X^*$ is a \uline{subgradient of $f$ at $x$} if for every $y \in D$ we have
    \begin{align*}
      f(y) - f(x) \geq \Prod {x^*} {y - x}.
    \end{align*}

    The \uline{subdifferential of $f$ at $x$} is denoted by $\partial f(x)$ and is also sometimes called the \uline{convex subdifferential} because of \cref{thm:convex_iff_subdifferential_nonempty}.

    \item\label{def:subdifferentials/clarke}\cite[definition 10.3]{Clarke2013} We say that $x^* \in X^*$ is a \uline{Clarke (generalized) subgradient of $f$ at $x$} if for every direction $h \in X$ we have
    \begin{align*}
      f^\circ(x)(h) \geq \Prod {x^*} h,
    \end{align*}
    where $f^\circ(x)(h)$ is the generalized Clarke derivative\Tinyref{def:derivatives/clarke}.

    The \uline{subdifferential of $f$ at $x$} is denoted by $\partial_C f(x)$. Confusingly, the Clarke subdifferential is called the \enquote{generalized gradient} by Clarke himself with no special name for the Clarke subgradients.

    See \cref{sec:clarke_gradients} for properties of these subgradients.

    \item\label{def:subdifferentials/proximal}\cite[227]{Clarke2013} We say that $x^* \in X^*$ is a \uline{proximal subgradient of $f$ at $x$} if there exist $\sigma > 0$ and a neighborhood $V \subseteq X$ of $x$ such that for every $y \in D \cap V$ we have
    \begin{align*}
      f(y) - f(x) + \sigma \Norm{y - x}^2 \geq \Prod {x^*} {y - x}.
    \end{align*}

    The \uline{proximal subdifferential of $f$ at $x$} is denoted by $\partial_P f(x)$.

    \item\label{def:subdifferentials/limiting}\cite[definition 11.10]{Clarke2013} Suppose the following are satisfied:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $\{ x_n \}_n \subseteq D$ is a sequence of points converging to $x$
      \item $f(x_n) \to f(x)$ (redundant if $f$ is continuous)
      \item $x_n^*$ is a proximal subgradient for $f$ at $x_n$ for every $n \in \BB{Z}^{>0}$.
    \end{enumerate}

    If the limit $x^* \coloneqq \lim_n x_n^*$ exists and is a continuous linear functional, we call $x^*$ a \uline{limiting subgradient of $f$ at $x$}.

    The \uline{limiting subdifferential of $f$ at $x$} is denoted by $\partial_P f(x)$.
  \end{defenum}
\end{definition}
