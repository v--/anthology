\subsection{Rational numbers}\label{subsec:rational_numbers}

\begin{definition}\label{def:rational_numbers}
  The \Def{rational numbers} \( \BQ \) are the field of \hyperref[def:field_of_fractions]{fractions} of the \hyperref[def:integers]{integers}. Both operations from \( \BZ \) are inherited in \( \BQ \) and all nonzero elements in \( \BQ \) are now invertible, which makes \( \BQ \) a field.
\end{definition}
