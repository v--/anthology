\begin{definition}
  \label{def:analysis:asplund:asplund_space}
  The Banach space $X$ is called an Asplund (resp. weak Asplund) space if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item(\cite[23]{Phelps1993}) Every continuous convex function on a convex open subset $D$ of $X$ is Frechet (resp. Gateaux) differentiable at a dense $G_\delta$ subset of $D$.
    \item(\cite[82]{Phelps1993}) The dual space $X^*$ has the Radon-Nikodym property.
    \item(\cite[86]{Phelps1993}) Every nonempty weak* compact convex subset of $X^*$ is the weak* closed convex hull of its weak* strongly exposed points.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
