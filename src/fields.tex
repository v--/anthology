\subsection{Fields}\label{subsec:fields}

\begin{definition}\label{def:field}
  As mentioned in \cref{def:semiring/field}, fields are commutative division rings.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:field_extension}
  If \( F \) and \( G \) are fields and \( G \) is a subring\Tinyref{def:first_order_structure/substructure} of \( F \), we say that \( G \) is a \Def{subfield} of \( F \) and that \( F \) is a \Def{field extension} of \( G \).

  Field extension are also denoted as \( F / G \) to highlight the roles of \( F \) and \( G \). This is not a quotient ring but simply a notation. See \cref{def:galois_group}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:galois_group}\cite[124]{Knapp2016BAlg}
  Let \( F \) be a field extension\Tinyref{def:field_extension} of \( G \). The group \( \Gal(F / G) \) of automorphisms of \( F \) that leave \( G \) fixed is called the \Def{Galois group} of the field extension \( F / G \).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:field_characteristic}
  We define the \Def{characteristic} of a field \( F \) as
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the smallest number of times \( 1 \) must be added to itself in order to obtain \( 0 \).
    \item zero if \( 0 \) cannot be obtained in this way.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
