\begin{definition}\label{def:separation_axioms}
  We can classify topological spaces using the following separation axioms. We say that $(X, \Cal{T})$ is

  \begin{description}
    \DItem{Regular}{def:separation_axioms/regular} every point $x \in X$ and every closed set $F \in \Cal{F}_{\Cal{T}}$ can be separated using neighborhoods, i.e. there exist disjoint open sets $U \ni x$ and $V \supseteq F$.
    \DItem{Completely regular}{def:separation_axioms/completely_regular} (Tychonoff) every point $x \in X$ and every closed set $F \in \Cal{F}_{\Cal{T}}$ can be functionally separated, i.e. there exists a continuous function $f: X \to [0, 1]$ such that $f(x) = 0$ and $f(F) = 1$.
    \DItem{Normal}{def:separation_axioms/normal} (Urysohn) every two closed sets $F, G \in \Cal{F}_{\Cal{T}}$ can be separated using neighborhoods, i.e. there exist disjoint open sets $U \supseteq F$ and $V \supseteq G$.
    \DItem{T0}{def:separation_axioms/T0} (Kolmogorov) for every two different points $x, y \in X$, there exists an open set $U \in \Cal{T}$ such that either $x \in U$ or $y \in U$.
    \DItem{T0.5}{def:separation_axioms/T0.5} every singleton set $\{ x \}$ is either open or closed.
    \DItem{T1}{def:separation_axioms/T1} (Frechet) every singleton set $\{ x \}$ is closed.
    \DItem{T2}{def:separation_axioms/T2} (Hausdorff) every two different points $x, y \in X$ can be separated using neighborhoods, i.e. there exist disjoint open sets $U \ni x$ and $V \ni y$.
    \DItem{T3}{def:separation_axioms/T3} the space is \ref{def:separation_axioms/T0} and \ref{def:separation_axioms/regular}
    \DItem{T3.5}{def:separation_axioms/T3.5} the space is \ref{def:separation_axioms/T0} and \ref{def:separation_axioms/completely_regular}
    \DItem{T4}{def:separation_axioms/T4} the space is \ref{def:separation_axioms/T1} and \ref{def:separation_axioms/normal}
