\subsection{Differentiability}\label{sec:differentiability}

Let \( X \) and \( Y \) be Hausdorff topological vector spaces\Tinyref{def:topological_vector_space}, let \( D \subseteq X \) be open and let \( D: X \to Y \) be any function.

\begin{definition}\label{def:derivatives}
  We fix a point \( x \in D \) and a direction \( h \in S_X \). We introduce a few definitions of derivatives. In all cases we say that \underLine{the derivative (of the corresponding type) exists for \( f \) at \( x \) in the direction \( h \)}. The quotient under the limit sign is called a \underLine{difference quotient} (of the corresponding type).

  \begin{defenum}
    \item\label{def:derivatives/classical} The classical \underLine{two-sided derivative} is defined as
    \begin{align*}
      f'(x)(h) \coloneqq \lim_{t \to 0} \frac {f(x + th) - f(x)} t
    \end{align*}

    This definition is often too strict and so there exist a few generalizations.

    \item\label{def:derivatives/onesided}\cite[lemma 1.2]{Phelps1993} The \underLine{one-sided (or right-hand) directional derivative} is defined as
    \begin{align*}
      f_+'(x)(h) \coloneqq \lim_{t \downarrow 0} \frac {f(x + th) - f(x)} t
    \end{align*}

    It is also denoted as \( \partial^+ f(x)(h) \) in~\cite[lemma 1.2]{Phelps1993}. We do not need to define a left-hand directional derivative because it would equal \( -f_+'(x)(-h) \).

    \item\label{def:derivatives/dini}\cite[definition 11.18]{Clarke2013} The \underLine{upper (resp. lower) Dini derivative} is defined as
    \begin{align*}
      \overline f'(x)(h) &\coloneqq \limsup_{t \downarrow 0} \frac {f(x + th) - f(x)} t
      \\
      \underline f(x)(h) &\coloneqq \liminf_{t \downarrow 0} \frac {f(x + th) - f(x)} t
    \end{align*}

    Dini derivatives are useful when the difference quotients are bounded but do not have a limit.

    \item\label{def:derivatives/clarke}\cite[Section 10.1]{Clarke2013} The \underLine{generalized Clarke derivative} is defined as
    \begin{align*}
      f^\circ(x)(h)
      &\coloneqq
      \limsup_{\substack{y \to x \\ t \downarrow 0}} \frac {f(y + th) - f(y)} t
      =
      \lim_{\delta \to 0} \sup_{\substack{y \in B(x, \delta) \\ t \in (0, \delta)}} \frac {f(y + th) - f(y)} t.
    \end{align*}

    Refer to~\cref{sec:clarke_gradients} for their usefulness.

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:differentiability}
  We fix a point \( x \in D \). We will now introduce several types of differentiability. Each is implied by the next one.

  \begin{defenum}
    \item We do not introduce a special name for functions that have a one-sided derivative at \( x \) in the direction \( h \), although some authors call these functions \underLine{Gateaux differentiable at \( x \) in the direction \( h \)}. % TODO: Give examples of such authors

    \item\label{def:differentiability/two-sided}\cite[0.2.1]{Ioffe1974} If the two-sided directional derivative \( f'(x)(h) \) exists for all directions \( h \in S_X \), we call it the \underLine{first variation at \( x \)} and denote the corresponding linear operator \( \delta f(x): X \to Y \).

    \item\label{def:differentiability/gateaux}\cite[definition 1.12]{Phelps1993} Let \( X \) be a Banach space. We say that \( f \) is Gateaux-differentiable at \( x \) if there exists a continuous linear operator \( f'_G(x): X \to Y \), called the Gateaux derivative of \( f \) at \( x \), such that
    \begin{align*}
      f'_G(x)(h) = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac {f(x + th) - f(x)} t.
    \end{align*}

    The Gateaux derivative \( f'_G(x) \) exists precisely when the first variation \( \delta f(x) \) operator exists and is continuous. They are obviously equal.

    The Gateaux derivative is also denoted by \( df(x) \) in~\cite[definition 1.12]{Phelps1993}.

    \item\label{def:differentiability/frechet}\cite[definition 1.12]{Phelps1993} Let \( X \) be a Banach space. We say that \( f \) is Frechet-differentiable at \( x \) if there exists a continuous linear operator \( f'(x): X \to Y \), called the Frechet derivative of \( f \) at \( x \), such that for each \( \varepsilon > 0 \) there exists a radius \( \delta > 0 \) such that and for every direction \( h \in S_X \) we have
    \begin{align*}
      t \in (0, \delta) \implies \Norm{ \frac {f(x + th) - f(x)} t - f'(x)(h)} < \varepsilon.
    \end{align*}

    Note that for each \( \varepsilon > 0 \), Gateaux differentiability gives us a radius \( \delta_h > 0 \) such that
    \begin{align*}
      t \in (0, \delta_h) \implies \Norm{ \frac {f(x + th) - f(x)} t - f_G'(x)(h)} < \varepsilon.
    \end{align*}

    If the limit is uniform over \( h \in S_X \), i.e. if \( \sup_{h \in S_X} \delta_h < \infty \), then \( f \) is Frechet differentiable at \( x \) and \( f'(x) = f'_G(x) \).

    \item\label{def:differentiability/strong}\cite[33]{Dontchev2014} We say that \underLine{\( f \) is strictly differentiable at \( x \)} if there exists a continuous linear operator \( f'(x): X \to Y \) such that
    \begin{align*}
      \lim_{\substack{y \to x \\ z \to x}} \frac{f(y) - f(z) - f'(x)(y - z)} {\Norm{y - z}} = 0.
    \end{align*}
  \end{defenum}
\end{definition}
