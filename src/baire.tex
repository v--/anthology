\begin{definition}\label{def:baire_space}
  A topological space is called a \uline{Baire space} if every nonempty set is not meager.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:open_subspace_of_baire_space_is_baire}
  Every open subspace of a Baire space is a Baire space.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let $(X, \tau)$ be a Baire space.

  Let $A \subseteq X$ be a nonempty open set and $\tau_A$ be the induced topology.

  Let $B \in \tau_A$ be nonempty. Then there exists a set $B' \in \tau$ such that $B = A \cap B'$. The sets $A$ and $B'$ are open and so $B = B' \cap A$ is open.

  Then $A$, $B$ and $B'$ are nonempty open sets, hence they are not meager in $\tau$.

  Suppose that $B$ in meager in $\tau_A$. Then there exists a sequence $B_1, B_2, \ldots$ of nowhere dense in $\tau_A$ sets such that
  \begin{align*}
    B = \cup_{k=1}^\infty B_k.
  \end{align*}

  We will now show that all $B_k$ are nowhere dense in $\tau$.

  Fix any $B_k$ and $U \in \tau$. Since $B_k$ is nowhere dense and $A \cap U$ is open, there exists a $V \in \tau_A$ such that $V \subseteq A \cap U$ and $V \cap B_k = \varnothing$.

  Let $V' \in \tau$ be such that $V = V' \cap A$. Since $V'$ and $A$ are open in $\tau$ and $V' \cap B_k = \varnothing$, we have that $B_k$ is nowhere dense in $\tau$.

  This implies that $B$ is meager as the union of countable nowhere dense subsets. But we have already proved that $B$ is nonmeager in $\tau$.

  The obtained contradiction proves that $B$ is nonmeager in $\tau_A$ also. Hence $(A, \tau_A)$ is a Baire space.
\end{proof}
