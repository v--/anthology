\subsection{Norms}\label{sec:norms}

\begin{definition}\cite[Example 2.26]{Phelps1993}
  We define the \textbf{duality mapping}
  \begin{align*}
    &D: E \rightrightarrows X^*, \\
    &D(x) \coloneqq \{ x^* \in X^* \colon \Norm x = \Norm {x^*} \text{ and } \Prod{x^*} x = \Norm {x^*} \Norm x \}.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
  We will usually use this mapping for unit vectors, so we may as well consider its restriction to the unit spheres, where
  \begin{align*}
    &D': S_X \rightrightarrows S_{X^*}, \\
    &D'(x) \coloneqq \{ x^* \in S_{X^*} \colon \Prod{x^*} x = 1 \}.
  \end{align*}
\end{note}

\begin{lemma}\label{thm:nonempty_banach_duality_mapping}
  For every point \( x \in X \), the set \( D(x) \) is nonempty.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Fix \( x \in X \) and consider the one-dimensional subspace
  \begin{align*}
    \Span \{ x \}
    =
    \{ \lambda x \colon \lambda \in \BB{R} \}.
  \end{align*}

  Define \( \xi: \Span \{ x \} \to \BB{R} \) by \( \xi(\lambda x) = \lambda {\Norm x}^2 \).

  The functional \( \xi \) is linear and, since it acts on a finite-dimensional space, it is also continuous. The norm of \( \xi \) is
  \begin{align*}
    \Norm{\xi} = \max \left\{ \Prod \xi {\frac x {\Norm x}}, \Prod \xi {-\frac x {\Norm x}} \right\} = \max \{ \Norm x, -\Norm x \} = \Norm x.
  \end{align*}

  The Hahn-Banach theorem allows us to extend \( \xi \) to a continuous linear functional \( x^* \in X^* \) such that \( \Norm{x^*} = \Norm{\xi} = \Norm x \) and \( \Prod{x^*} x = \Prod \xi x = \Norm{x}^2 = \Norm x \Norm {x^*} \). Thus \( x^* \in D(x) \) and \( D(x) \) is nonempty.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:smooth_norm}\cite[Definition 2.36]{Phelps1993}
  The norm \( \Norm \cdot \) on \( X \) is called \textbf{smooth} if any of  if for each \( x \in S_X \) the duality mapping is single-valued.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:rotund_norm}\cite[Definition 2.36]{Phelps1993}
  The norm \( \Norm \cdot \) on \( X \) is called \textbf{rotund} or \textbf{strictly convex} if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:
  \begin{defenum}
    \item\label{def:rotund_norm/no_sphere_segments} There are no line segments in the unit sphere \( S_X \).
    \item\label{def:rotund_norm/least_norm} Every convex subset of \( X \) has at most one point of least norm.
    \item\label{def:rotund_norm/linearly_dependent}
    \begin{align}\label{def:rotund_norm/linearly_dependent/equation}
      \Norm{x + y} = \Norm x + \Norm y \implies x \text{ and } y \text{ are linearly dependent}.
    \end{align}
  \end{defenum}
\end{definition}
\begin{proof}
  (\ref{def:rotund_norm/no_sphere_segments} \( \implies \) \ref{def:rotund_norm/least_norm}) Let the norm in \( E \) be rotund and let \( C \subseteq E \) be a (potentially empty) convex set. We will prove that \( C \) contains at most one point of least norm.

  If \( C \) is empty or otherwise contains no element of least norm, trivially contains at most one point of least norm.

  Now let \( C \) contain at least one element \( x \in C \) of least norm. Assume that \( y \in C \) is another element of least norm. Necessarily \( \Norm x = \Norm y \).

  Fix \( t \in (0, 1) \) and define \( z \coloneqq tx + (1-t)y \). Since \( C \) is convex, it contains \( z \). Since \( x \) and \( y \) are elements of least norm, we have \( \Norm z \geq \Norm x \). By the triangle inequality,
  \begin{align*}
    \Norm{z}
    =
    \Norm{tx + (1-t)y}
    \leq
    t \Norm x + (1-t) \Norm y
    =
    \Norm{x},
  \end{align*}
  thus \( \Norm z = \Norm x \).

  This implies that the entire segment \( [x, y] \) are elements of least norm in \( C \). Hence the segment \( [x, y] \) is contained in the sphere \( \Norm x S_E \), which contradicts the rotundity of the norm \( \Norm{\cdot} \).

  Hence \( C \) contains at most one element of least norm.

  (\ref{def:rotund_norm/least_norm} \( \implies \) \ref{def:rotund_norm/no_sphere_segments}) Let every convex set \( C \subseteq E \) have at most one element of least norm.

  Assume\LEM that the norm \( \Norm{\cdot} \) is not rotund. Then the unit sphere \( S_E \) contains a line segment \( [x, y], x \neq y \). The set \( [x, y] \) is compact and, by the Weierstrass extreme value theorem, the norm attains its minimum on the segment in a point \( z \in [x, y] \). Since the segment is also convex and we assumed that convex sets have at most one element of least norm, it follows that this element \( z \) is unique.

  Then for any point \( s \in [x, y], s \neq z \), we have \( \Norm s > \Norm z = 1 \), thus \( s \) cannot be an element of the unit sphere. The obtained contradiction shows that the norm \( \Norm{\cdot} \) is rotund.

  (\ref{def:rotund_norm/no_sphere_segments} \( \implies \) \ref{def:rotund_norm/linearly_dependent}) Let \( E \) be rotund let \( x, y \in E \) be distinct vectors such that
  \begin{align}\label{def:rotund_norm/linearly_dependent/assumption}
    \Norm{x + y} = \Norm x + \Norm y.
  \end{align}

  If either of them is the zero vector, then they are trivially linearly dependent.

  Assume that both \( x \) and \( y \) are nonzero and define
  \begin{align*}
    \xi \coloneqq \frac x {\Norm x}
    &&
    \eta \coloneqq \frac y {\Norm y}
    &&
    t \coloneqq \frac {\Norm x} {\Norm{x + y}}
  \end{align*}

  \Cref{def:rotund_norm/linearly_dependent/assumption} implies that
  \begin{align*}
    1 - t = 1 - \frac {\Norm x} {\Norm{x + y}} = \frac {\Norm{x + y} - \Norm x} {\Norm{x + y}} = \frac {\Norm y} {\Norm{x+y}}.
  \end{align*}

  Since both \( \xi \) and \( \eta \) are in \( S_E \), by rotundity, their convex combination
  \begin{align*}
    \nu \coloneqq t \xi + (1-t)\eta
  \end{align*}
  should not be contained in \( S_E \) unless \( \xi = \eta \).

  Calculating the norm, we obtain
  \begin{align*}
    \Norm{\nu}
    &=
    \Norm{t \xi + (1-t)\eta}
    = \\ &=
    \Norm{\frac {\Norm x \xi} {\Norm{x + y}} + \frac {\Norm y \eta} {\Norm{x + y}}}
    = \\ &=
    \Norm{\frac {x + y} {\Norm{x + y}}}
    = 1,
  \end{align*}
  hence \( \nu \in S_E \). Thus \( \xi = \eta \) and \( x = \frac {\Norm x} {\Norm y} y \), so \( x \) and \( y \) are linearly dependent.

  (\ref{def:rotund_norm/linearly_dependent} \( \implies \) \ref{def:rotund_norm/no_sphere_segments}) Let \cref{def:rotund_norm/linearly_dependent/equation} hold and fix \( x, y \in S_E, t \in (0, 1) \). Define \( z \coloneqq tx + (1-t)y \).
  First, assume that the vectors \( tx \) and \( (1-t)y \) satisfy the left part of~\cref{def:rotund_norm/linearly_dependent/equation}, i.e.
  \begin{align*}
     \Norm z = \Norm{tx + (1-t)y} = t \Norm x + (1-t) \Norm y = 1.
  \end{align*}

  This does not refute rotundity since \( x \) and \( y \) are not necessarily distinct. It follows from~\cref{def:rotund_norm/linearly_dependent/equation} that \( tx \) and \( (1-t)y \) are linearly dependent, hence \( x \) and \( y \) are also linearly dependent. Since \( x \) and \( y \) both have unit norm, either \( y = x \) or \( y = -x \).

  If we assume that \( y = -x \), then
  \begin{align*}
    \Norm z
    =
    \Norm{tx + (1-t)y}
    =
    (2t - 1) \Norm x
    =
    2t - 1,
  \end{align*}
  which is only possible if \( t = 1 \) since \( \Norm z = 1 \). But \( t \) is strictly less than 1.

  Hence \( y \neq -x \) and the only remaining possibility is that \( y = x \).

  Now assume that the vectors \( tx \) and \( (1-t)y \) do not satisfy the left part of~\cref{def:rotund_norm/linearly_dependent/equation}. This implies \( \Norm z < 1 \). Thus \( x \) and \( y \) are necessarily distinct, but \( z \) is not contained in the unit sphere and the segment \( [x, y] \) is not contained in \( S_E \).

  We have shown that \( x, y \in S_E \) implies that either \( y = x \) or that the segment \( [x, y] \) is not contained in \( S_E \), thus the norm in \( E \) is rotund.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:smooth_rotund_norm_duality}\cite[exercise 2.37(a]{Phelps1993})
  If the norm in \( X \) is such that its dual norm in \( X^* \) is rotund (resp. smooth), then it is itself smooth (resp. rotund).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item First, let the dual norm \( \Norm{\cdot}^* \) be rotund and assume that \( \Norm{\cdot} \) is not smooth.

    Fix \( x \in S_X \). Since \( D(x) \) is nonempty (by~\cref{thm:nonempty_banach_duality_mapping}) and since \( \Norm{\cdot} \) is not smooth, then there exist two different functionals \( x^*, y^* \in D(x) \), such that
    \begin{align*}
      \Prod {x^*} x
      =
      \Prod {y^*} x
      =
      1.
    \end{align*}

    We will show that the segment \( [x^*, y^*] \) is contained in \( S_{X^*} \), i.e. that the dual norm is not rotund.

    Fix any \( t \in (0, 1) \) and define \( z^* \coloneqq t x^* + (1-t) y^* \). We only need to show that \( \Norm{z^*} = 1 \).

    By the triangle inequality, we have
    \begin{align*}
      \Norm{z^*}
      =
      \Norm{t x^* + (1-t) y^*}
      \leq
      t \Norm{x^*} + (1-t) \Norm{y^*}
      =
      t + (1-t)
      =
      1.
    \end{align*}

    For the reverse inequality, note that
    \begin{align*}
      \Norm{z^*}
      \geq
      \Prod {z^*} x
      =
      t \Prod {x^*} x + (1-t) \Prod {y^*} x
      =
      t + (1-t)
      =
      1,
    \end{align*}
    thus \( \Norm{z^*} = 1 \). Hence \( [x^*, y^*] \) is contained in \( S_{X^*} \) and the dual space is not smooth. The obtained contradiction proves that the norm in \( X \) is rotund.

    \item Now let the dual norm \( \Norm{\cdot}^* \) be smooth and assume that \( \Norm{\cdot} \) is not rotund. Then there exist points \( x, y \in S_X \) such that the while segment \( [x, y] \) is contained in \( S_X \).

    Fix \( t \in (0, 1) \) and define \( z \coloneqq tx + (1-t)y \in S_X \). Denote by \( J: X \to X^{**} \) the canonical embedding into the double-dual. By~\cref{thm:nonempty_banach_duality_mapping}, there exists a functional \( z^* \in X^* \), such that
    \begin{align*}
      \Prod {J(z)} {z^*}
      =
      \Prod{z^*} z
      =
      1.
    \end{align*}

    Because the dual norm \( \Norm{\cdot}^* \) is smooth, we cannot have \( \Prod{J(x)} {z^*} =  \Prod{z^*} x = 1 \) or \( \Prod{J(y)} {z^*} = \Prod{z^*} y = 1 \) and since \( \Norm{z^*} = 1 \), necessarily
    \begin{align*}
      \Prod{z^*} x < 1 \text{ and } \Prod{z^*} y < 1.
    \end{align*}

    If follows that
    \begin{align*}
      1
      =
      \Prod{z^*} z
      =
      t \Prod{z^*} x + (1-t) \Prod{z^*} y
      <
      t + (1-t)
      =
      1,
    \end{align*}
    which is a contradiction. Hence \( \Norm{\cdot} \) is rotund.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:hilbert_space_smooth_rotund}\cite[exercise 2.37(c]{Phelps1993})
  Norms in Hilbert spaces are both smooth and rotund.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let \( X \) be a Hilbert space, i.e. the norm is generated by an inner product and, due to Riesz's theorem, we identify the space \( X \) with its continuous dual \( X^* \).

  To prove that \( X \) is rotund, choose \( x, y \in S_X, x \neq y \). We will show that the segment \( [x, y] \) is not contained in \( S_X \).

  If \( x \) and \( y \) are linearly dependent, necessarily \( y = -x \) and all non-trivial convex combinations of \( x \) and \( y \) are contained in the open unit ball, hence \( [x, y] \not\subseteq S_X \).

  Not let \( x \) and \( y \) be linearly independent. By the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality, we have
  \begin{align}\label{eq:hilbert_cauchy_inequality}
    \Prod x y \leq \Abs{\Prod x y} < \Norm x \Norm y = 1.
  \end{align}

  Fix \( t \in (0, 1) \) and let \( z \coloneqq tx + (1-t)y \). We will show that \( z \not\in S_X \). Indeed,
  \begin{align*}
    \Norm{z}^2
    =
    \Prod z z
    &=
    t^2 \Norm x^2 + t(1-t) \Prod x y + (1-t) t \Prod y x + (1-t)^2 \Norm y^2
    = \\ &=
    t^2 + (1-t)^2 + 2 t(1-t) \Prod x y
    < \\ &\overset {(\ref{eq:hilbert_cauchy_inequality})} <
    t^2 + (1-t)^2 + 2 t(1-t)
    = \\ &=
    t^2 + 1 - 2t + t^2 + 2t - t^2
    =
    1.
  \end{align*}

  Thus \( \Norm{z}^2 < 1 \) and \( \Norm z < 1 \) and \( z \not\in S_X \).

  In both cases, no interior point of the segment \( [x, y] \) is contained in \( S_X \), hence the norm in \( X \) is rotund.

  Since we identify \( X \) with its dual, the norm in \( X^* \) is also rotund and by~\cref{thm:smooth_rotund_norm_duality}, the norm in \( X \) is also smooth.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}\label{thm:c0_l1_not_smooth_rotund}\cite[exercise 2.37(c]{Phelps1993})
  The norms in \( c_0 \) and \( l^1 \) are neither smooth nor rotund.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
  Consider the space \( c_0 \) of all real sequences that converge to zero equipped with the uniform norm
  \begin{align*}
    \Norm{x}_{c_0} \coloneqq \sup_i \Abs{x_i}.
  \end{align*}

  Note that the dual space of \( c_0 \) is (isometrically isomorphic to) the space \( l^1 \) of absolutely summable sequences with norm
  \begin{align*}
    \Norm{x}_{l^1} \coloneqq \sum_i \Abs{x_i}.
  \end{align*}

  Let \( \{ e_n \}_{n=1}^\infty \) be the canonical basis of \( c_0 \), i.e. the coordinates \( e^{(i)}_n \) of \( e_n \) are given by the Dirac delta function, \( e^{(i)}_n \coloneqq \delta_{i,n} \).

  For every natural \( n \geq 1 \), define \( x_n \) to be the same as \( e_n \) except that the first coordinate of \( x_n \) is always \( 1 \).

  The corresponding norms of \( e_n \) are all equal to 1 and the norms of \( x_n \) are
  \begin{align*}
    \Norm{x_n}_{c_0} = 1
    &&
    \Norm{x_n}_{l^1} = 2.
  \end{align*}

  For every \( n \) we have
  \begin{align*}
    \Prod {e_1} {x_n} = \Prod {e_n} {x_n} = 1,
  \end{align*}
  hence \( J_{c_0}(x_n) \) has at least two elements \( e_1 \) and \( e_n \) and the norm in \( c_0 \) is not smooth.

  Given that \( \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots \} \subseteq S_{c_0} \), consider the convex combinations of \( x_2 \) and \( x_3 \):
  \begin{align*}
    tx_2 + (1-t)x_3
    =
    (1, t, (1-t), 0, 0, \ldots).
  \end{align*}

  Evidently \( tx_2 + (1-t)x_3 \in S_{c_0} \) for every \( t \in (0, 1) \), hence the norm in \( c_0 \) is not rotund.

  The contrapositions\LEM to the statements in~\cref{thm:smooth_rotund_norm_duality} say that if \( X \) is not rotund (resp. smooth), then the dual space \( X^* \) is not smooth (resp. rotund). Thus \( l^1 \) is neither smooth or rotund as the dual of \( c_0 \).
\end{proof}
