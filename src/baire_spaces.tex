\subsection{Baire spaces}\label{subsec:baire_spaces}

\begin{definition}\label{def:baire_space}
  A topological space is called a \textbf{Baire space} if every nonempty set is not meager.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{thm:open_subspace_of_baire_space_is_baire}
  Every open subspace of a Baire space is a Baire space.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let \( (X, \Cal{T}) \) be a Baire space.

  Let \( A \subseteq X \) be a nonempty open set and \( \Cal{T}_A \) be the induced topology.

  Let \( B \in \Cal{T}_A \) be nonempty. Then there exists a set \( B' \in \Cal{T} \) such that \( B = A \cap B' \). The sets \( A \) and \( B' \) are open and so \( B = B' \cap A \) is open.

  Then \( A \), \( B \) and \( B' \) are nonempty open sets, hence they are not meager in \( \Cal{T} \).

  Suppose that \( B \) in meager in \( \Cal{T}_A \). Then there exists a sequence \( B_1, B_2, \ldots \) of nowhere dense in \( \Cal{T}_A \) sets such that
  \begin{align*}
    B = \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty B_k.
  \end{align*}

  We will now show that all \( B_k \) are nowhere dense in \( \Cal{T} \).

  Fix any \( B_k \) and \( U \in \Cal{T} \). Since \( B_k \) is nowhere dense and \( A \cap U \) is open, there exists a \( V \in \Cal{T}_A \) such that \( V \subseteq A \cap U \) and \( V \cap B_k = \varnothing \).

  Let \( V' \in \Cal{T} \) be such that \( V = V' \cap A \). Since \( V' \) and \( A \) are open in \( \Cal{T} \) and \( V' \cap B_k = \varnothing \), we have that \( B_k \) is nowhere dense in \( \Cal{T} \).

  This implies that \( B \) is meager as the union of countable nowhere dense subsets. But we have already proved that \( B \) is nonmeager in \( \Cal{T} \).

  The obtained contradiction proves that \( B \) is nonmeager in \( \Cal{T}_A \) also. Hence \( (A, \Cal{T}_A) \) is a Baire space.
\end{proof}
