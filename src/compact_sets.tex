Let $(X, \tau)$ be a topological space.

\begin{definition}\label{def:compact_set}\cite[40]{Deimling1985}
  The set $A \subseteq X$ is called \uline{compact} if any of the following equivalent conditions hold:
  \begin{defenum}
    \item\label{def:compact_set/union} (\uline{Finite union property}) Every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover.
    \item\label{def:compact_set/intersection} (\uline{Finite intersection property}) The intersection is nonempty for every family of sets such that the intersection of any finite subfamily is nonempty.
  \end{defenum}

  If the closure if $A$ is compact, we call $A$~\uline{relatively compact} or \uline{precompact} (although the term \enquote{precompact} is also used for totally bounded sets, see \ref{def:totally_bounded_set}).
\end{definition}
